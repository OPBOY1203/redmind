# Scripts

This folder contains various scripts I've written while working through different projects and labs. 

They're mostly rough working files, quick utilities, testing snippets, and automation helpers, meant to be reused or built on later.

I'll keep adding new ones here as I make them or clean up older versions.

> Although these scripts are generally safe, their primary purpose was for individual practice, use, and reference.
