# Box Reports

This directory contains technical summaries from individual machine engagements and assessment challenges. 

Each report is derived from my detailed notes and full engagement documentation but focuses on key technical points, methodologies, and outcomes.

These reports include:
- **Hack The Box** machines
- **Academy end-of-chapter assessments**
- **Skill challenges**

They are designed as quick reference or “point-forward” documentation rather than full walkthroughs, highlighting methodology, command usage, and key takeaways from each engagement.
