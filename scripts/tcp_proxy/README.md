# TCP Proxy Tool

This script (`proxy.py`) is a simple TCP proxy designed for inspecting, relaying, and optionally modifying traffic between a local client and a remote host. It's useful for debugging, learning protocol structures, and performing man-in-the-middle style analysis in controlled environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Usage

``` bash
python3 proxy.py [localhost] [localport] [remotehost] [remoteport] [receive_first]
```

### Example

``` bash
python3 proxy.py 127.0.0.1 9000 example.com 80 True
```

-   `localhost`: Local interface to listen on (e.g., `127.0.0.1`)
-   `localport`: Local port to bind (e.g., `9000`)
-   `remotehost`: Remote host to connect to (e.g., `example.com`)
-   `remoteport`: Remote port to connect to (e.g., `80`)
-   `receive_first`: `True` if the remote server sends data immediately upon connection (common with some banners or protocol greetings), else `False`.
