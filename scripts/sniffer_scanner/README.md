# Python Network Sniffer & UDP/ICMP Scanner

## Scripts

 `icmp_sniffer.py`

A minimal ICMP sniffer that parses IP headers and ICMP headers from captured packets.

-   Prints out:
    -   Source and destination addresses
    -   Protocol
    -   IP version, header length, TTL
    -   ICMP type and code

**Usage:**

``` bash
# Linux/macOS (requires sudo)
sudo python3 icmp_sniffer.py 0.0.0.0

# Windows (run as admin, bind to your local IP)
python icmp_sniffer.py 192.168.56.1
```

`udp_icmp_scanner.py`

A UDP spray and ICMP response sniffer that discovers live hosts by sending UDP packets containing a magic payload across a subnet, then listening for ICMP Type 3 / Code 3 (Port Unreachable) replies.

-   **Default subnet:** `192.168.56.0/24`
-   **Magic string:** `DoNoT3tHi$`
-   **Destination port:** `65212`

Hosts that respond with an ICMP error containing the magic string are reported as up.

**Usage:**

``` bash
# Linux/macOS (requires sudo)
sudo python3 udp_icmp_scanner.py 0.0.0.0

# Windows (run as admin, bind to your local IP)
python udp_icmp_scanner.py 192.168.56.1
```
