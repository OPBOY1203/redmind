# RedMind – Offensive Operations Workbench

RedMind exists because most note repos turn into digital landfills. I trimmed the fat. What’s left here is what actually matters to me: working binaries that shouldn’t exist but do, write-ups that reflect real decision-making under pressure, curated runbooks for techniques that I actually want at hand during an engagement, and some curated box reports.

This isn’t a CTF trophy shelf. It’s a growing record of adaptability, break-fix mindset and forward-compatibility obsession. If something broke because it was built for glibc 2.39 and I only had 2.31, I rebuilt it, documented how, and left a breadcrumb for anyone else stuck in dependency hell. That matters more to me than just “getting a shell”.

## What’s Inside
- **Binaries** – Legacy-compatible, rebuilt tools for old systems. If something refused to run on a 2012 box, I'll make it behave.
- **Box Reports** – HTB and lab machines. Each entry contains enumeration notes, exploit chains, privilege escalation, and cleanup steps.
- **Runbooks** – Condensed tactical procedures for things I want muscle memory on (Shadow Creds, ADCS relay, pivot chains, etc). These are field notes, not tutorials.
- **Scripts** – Small tools and helpers I wrote myself. Imperfect, but mine. Everything here actually came from problem-solving, and necessity.
- **Write-Ups** – Long-form pieces where I break something down cleanly, usually after I’ve had enough distance to explain it properly.

## Why This Repo Exists
Because I wanted a place that reflects how I operate: direct, adaptable and not allergic to dirty work. I value backwards compatibility, controlled chaos, and having working artifacts I can drop into a target without praying for matching library versions. I also value transparency – if I pivoted through a DMZ box using Ligolo, I want the sequence written exactly how it happened, not cleaned up into some corporate PDF.

If someone stumbles across this repo and finds something useful, great. But it exists first and foremost as my offensive bench – a kit that evolves as I do.
