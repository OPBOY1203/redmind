# RedMind

A living repository for offensive security labs, field notes, system scripts, and practical cybersecurity work. This repo documents both technical development and red‑team activity, a personal portfolio and tactical log.

I’m a former infrastructure technician now focused on offensive security, with strong experience in Linux systems, endpoint hardening, scripting, and adversarial methodology.

## What’s inside

### Binaries

A curated collection of binaries I’ve compiled to support older systems encountered during engagements where modern releases were incompatible or unavailable.

* Binaries are adjusted to work with older **glibc** and **OpenSSL** versions, or otherwise documented.
* Build instructions are included for anyone who needs to compile updated or alternate builds.

---

### Box reports

Concise reports for Hack The Box, VulnHub, and other lab machines. Each entry contains enumeration notes, exploit chains, privilege escalation, and cleanup steps.

* Intended as quick, point‑forward documentation rather than full formal reports.
* Focused on methodology, exact commands used, and key takeaways from each engagement.

---

### Pentest notes

Rapid‑reference material for enumeration, reverse shells, SQLi, privilege escalation, and common pentest tasks.

* This section is continuously evolving and will be reorganized over time.

---

### Scripts

Pragmatic scripts and small utilities created or adapted for day‑to‑day ops and lab work.

* Simple, opinionated tools for networking, recon automation, Git hygiene, and logging.
* Pull requests welcome if they keep the same lightweight, practical approach.

---

### Write‑ups

Short technical walkthroughs that cover the essentials and show the path to a solution; intentionally brief and actionable.

---

## Current focus

* Red‑team workflows and exploit development
* Privilege escalation on Linux & Windows
* Python and Bash for automation and recon
* OSCP‑aligned methodology
* HTB Academy — Penetration Tester pathway
